

i want to implement the Save file , and the file must be synced with the webcontainer code

ðŸ“¦ 1. Mount initial files into WebContainer
You already did this:


await webcontainerInstance.mount(initialFiles);


ðŸ”„ 2. Write updates from host â†’ container
Whenever your host editor or UI saves changes, use:


await webcontainerInstance.fs.writeFile(path, newContent);
This ensures the containerâ€™s in-memory filesystem reflects your edits.

ðŸ‘€ 3. Watch for file changes inside the container
To feed changes back into your code viewer/editor after modifications from within the container or by external writes, set up a watcher:


const watcher = await webcontainerInstance.fs.watch('/', { recursive: true });
watcher.on('change', async (eventType, changedPath) => {
  if (changedPath === activeFile && eventType === 'change') {
    const updated = await webcontainerInstance.fs.readFile(changedPath, 'utf-8');
    editor.setValue(updated);
  }
});
This detects, reads, and updates the active file view 
webcontainers.io
.

ðŸ§­ 4. Load file when user selects it
When switching to a different file:


async function openFile(path) {
  activeFile = path;
  const content = await webcontainerInstance.fs.readFile(path, 'utf-8');
  editor.setValue(content);
}
This ensures the editor always shows the latest content.




Now i want to tell you something to implement just a save button after the "Generate Client" button the save button should be green in color.
