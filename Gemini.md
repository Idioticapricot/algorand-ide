i want to add another param to the Algorand-IDE compoenent which is hte name of the template 

it should pass the name of the template 


it should show what template is it loading please implement that

cause i am getting templates from local file.ts and the github so they be messy so it will be a best idea to show the name of the template we are loading on to the Algorand-IDE component
